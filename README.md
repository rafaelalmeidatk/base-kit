### Base kit

An awesome kit with components like Modal, Dropdown, Slide, NavigationDrawer and some really good styles ( based on bootstrap 4 ) written in scss.

The goal of this repo is to be used as an base "project of `create-react-app`" with configurable styles. Thus allowing a rich and easy way to develop UX-friendly apps.
